        SetTargetFPS(60);
        while ( !WindowShouldClose() ) {
            my $x = GetScreenWidth() / 2;
            my $y = GetScreenHeight() / 2;
            BeginDrawing();
            ClearBackground( Color->new( r => 0, g => 0, b => 0, a => 0 ) );
            DrawFPS( 0, 0 );
            DrawText( "Hello, world!",
                $x, $y, 20, Color->new( r => 255, g => 255, b => 255, a => 255 ) );
            EndDrawing();
        }
        CloseWindow();

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides Perl bindings for the raylib library using
    FFI::Platyus. This is functional but very low level. You probably want
    to use Raylib::App instead.
